What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My classes (Computer, ResaleShop) have all the needed attributes and all the functions execute seamlessly. I also include header comments and my code returns no error or freeze when the program runs. My only concern is the resaleshop returns "None" everytime it successfully completes a task. I guess this is because the return type is None, and this feature will need to be updated the next time I work on a project. 

My advice to someone taking this course is to focus on the Class lessons in CSC 111/CSC 110, as they will come into handy in OOP-thinking. Also come to class and watch all the videos, they help a lot.
